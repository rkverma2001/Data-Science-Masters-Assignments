    "Ans. In Python, an exception refers to an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exceptional situation arises, Python raises an exception, which interrupts the normal flow of the program and transfers control to a specific block of code designed to handle the exception. This process is known as exception handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions allow us to gracefully handle errors and unexpected situations that may arise while our program is running. They help you write more robust and fault-tolerant code by providing a mechanism to catch and handle errors rather than letting them cause your program to crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a range of built-in exceptions that cover common types of errors, such as `TypeError`, `ValueError`, `FileNotFoundError`, and `IndexError`, among others. Additionally, you can create custom exceptions by deriving classes from the base `Exception` class or its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception occurs, Python looks for an exception handler that can handle the specific type of exception raised. If an appropriate handler is found, the program jumps to that handler and executes the code within it. If no suitable handler is found, the program terminates and displays an error message traceback, which provides information about the exception that occurred and the sequence of function calls leading up to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle exceptions, you can use the `try-except` statement. The `try` block contains the code that may raise an exception, and the `except` block(s) specify the code to be executed if a particular exception occurs. By handling exceptions, you can gracefully recover from errors, log them, provide meaningful error messages, or take alternative actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of handling a `ZeroDivisionError` exception that occurs when dividing a number by zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "    print(result)\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the code in the `try` block raises a `ZeroDivisionError` because we are attempting to divide by zero. The program then jumps to the `except` block, where the error message \"Error: Cannot divide by zero.\" is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception handling is a crucial part of writing reliable and maintainable Python code, allowing you to anticipate and handle unexpected situations that might otherwise lead to program failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions and syntax errors are both types of errors that can occur in Python programs, but they differ in their nature and when they occur. Here's a breakdown of the differences between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Nature:\n",
    "   - Syntax Error: A syntax error occurs when the Python interpreter encounters invalid code that does not conform to the language's syntax rules. It usually happens due to typos, missing or misplaced punctuation, incorrect indentation, or improper use of keywords. Syntax errors prevent the program from running at all.\n",
    "   - Exception: An exception, on the other hand, occurs during the execution of a program when an unexpected situation arises or an error condition is encountered. Exceptions can occur even if the code is syntactically correct and can be handled using exception handling mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Occurrence:\n",
    "   - Syntax Error: Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing phase, before the code is executed. When the interpreter encounters a syntax error, it raises a `SyntaxError` and provides information about the location and nature of the error.\n",
    "   - Exception: Exceptions occur at runtime when a certain condition triggers an exceptional situation. They can arise from various scenarios, such as arithmetic errors (e.g., division by zero), accessing an index out of range, attempting to open a non-existent file, or calling a method on an object that doesn't support it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Handling:\n",
    "   - Syntax Error: Since syntax errors prevent the program from running, they need to be fixed before the program can be executed successfully. The interpreter will display a traceback pointing to the line where the syntax error occurred, helping you identify and correct the issue.\n",
    "   - Exception: Exceptions can be handled using exception handling mechanisms, such as `try-except` statements. By wrapping code that may raise exceptions in a `try` block and providing appropriate `except` blocks, you can catch and handle exceptions gracefully. This allows you to control the program's flow and take alternative actions when exceptions occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, syntax errors are detected during the parsing phase and prevent the program from running, while exceptions occur at runtime due to specific conditions and can be handled using exception handling mechanisms. Syntax errors need to be fixed before the program can run, while exceptions can be anticipated and gracefully handled within the code."

    "When an exception is not handled, it leads to the termination of the program and the display of an error message traceback.

    "\n",
    "result = divide_numbers(num1, num2)\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `divide_numbers` function is defined to perform division between two numbers. The program attempts to divide `num1` by `num2`, where `num2` is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the division operation is executed, it raises a `ZeroDivisionError` exception because dividing by zero is mathematically undefined. Since there is no exception handler present to catch and handle this exception, the program terminates and displays an error message traceback:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 6, in <module>\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 2, in divide_numbers\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The traceback shows the error occurred in the `divide_numbers` function (line 2) and points out that it's a `ZeroDivisionError`. It also shows that the error was triggered by the division operation in the main program (line 6).\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is not handled, the program stops execution at the point where the exception occurred and terminates. This behavior can be undesirable in many cases, especially in larger programs or critical systems where you want to ensure the program continues running despite encountering errors. Proper exception handling allows you to catch and handle exceptions, providing an opportunity to recover from errors, log them for debugging purposes, or take alternative actions to prevent program termination."

    "It's worth noting that you can have multiple `except` blocks to handle different types of exceptions. Additionally, you can have a general `except` block without specifying a particular exception type to catch any exception that is not caught by the preceding `except` blocks. However, it's generally recommended to be specific with the exception types you handle, as catching all exceptions may hide unexpected errors and make debugging more challenging."

    "In Python, custom exceptions are user-defined exceptions that you create by defining a new class that inherits from the built-in `Exception` class or its subclasses. Custom exceptions allow you to define and raise your own exceptional conditions specific to your application or domain. They provide a way to handle exceptional situations that are not covered by the built-in exceptions.\n",

    "1. **Specificity**: Custom exceptions allow you to define and raise exceptions that are specific to your application's requirements or domain. By creating custom exceptions, you can provide more meaningful error messages and handle exceptional situations with more granularity. This can improve the clarity and maintainability of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hierarchy**: Custom exceptions can be organized into a hierarchy by creating a class hierarchy of exception classes. This allows you to have different levels of exception handling and catch specific types of exceptions at different levels of your code. You can create a base custom exception class and derive more specific exception classes from it, adding additional functionality as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Separation of Concerns**: Custom exceptions help separate the code that raises exceptions from the code that handles them. By defining custom exceptions, you can raise them in one part of your code, while handling them in a different part. This separation of concerns improves the overall structure and readability of your code.\n",
